My name is Patrikas Adomaitis, and I graduated in Software Engineering from Vilnius Tech University, Vilnius, Lithuania.

I was introduced to computers at the age of six when my sister let me play Counter-Strike on our family’s new PC. Over time, I was allowed to use the computer more and more—my skills grew from simply launching Mozilla Firefox and watching my first YouTube video to experimenting with software, games, and system settings.

By the age of 14, I had built my first computer and developed a strong interest in tinkering with both hardware and software. In 2019, while still in school, I joined NKKM (Naujos Kartos Kompiuterių Mokykla). During my first year there, I explored a wide range of topics: building PCs from scratch, installing operating systems from Windows 95 to Ubuntu, editing Windows registry keys, coding in VB, and more.

In the second year, students had to choose a specialization: System Administration, Software Engineering, or Web Development. I initially chose System Administration, but since the class did not form, I enrolled in Software Engineering. That is where I truly discovered programming—and more importantly, the language that made me fall in love with it: C# (C Sharp).

I had already done some coding in high school with C++, but it never really excited me (most of our assignments were basic console exercises). C# was different—it showed me how powerful and versatile programming could be. With .NET, I could easily access libraries and external resources, which opened up endless opportunities for experimentation.

During this period, I built a variety of small projects, including:

Web scrapers for testing data extraction

Discord bots that monitored Steam player ban statuses

Windows Forms apps for automating tasks like pulling recipes from websites

Custom tools that interacted with system settings, firewalls, and audio

(All of these projects were created privately for fun and learning purposes.)

C# completely changed my perspective on programming, and even improved my C++ skills through cross-language learning. This enthusiasm contributed to me scoring 92/100 on my IT exam.

Interestingly, the System Administration group that year was later disbanded because in-person learning was required—so even if I had gotten in, I would have been removed. In hindsight, I was lucky: being “forced” into Software Engineering ultimately set the right path for me.

After finishing school, I began my studies at Vilnius Tech University. During my first semester, I landed a job at TopoCentras, then later moved on to Barbora, and eventually joined Danske Bank. At Danske Bank, I worked as a Full Stack Mainframe Engineer (Student position), though in practice my role focused heavily on C# backend development.

There, I learned professional software engineering practices:

Writing clean, maintainable code

Unit and integration testing

Code reviews

Deployment processes

Working with tools like Docker, NSwag, and Postman

Designing and building APIs

This role gave me hands-on experience in real-world software development and confirmed my passion for backend engineering.
